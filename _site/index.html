<h2 id="introduction--professional-self-assessment">Introduction &amp; Professional Self Assessment</h2>
<p>My name is Caleb and I started pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering in October of 2022. With a full-time job and five young children, time management has been one of the most essential skills I’ve had to utilize and master throughout this program. Balancing work, family, and my academic responsibilities has pushed me to be deliberate and organized in my approach to learning.</p>

<p>As I’ve progressed through the program, I’ve been able to further develop my strong problem-solving skills by working through complex challenges, iterating quickly, and learning when and how to adapt when things haven’t gone as planned. Some of my assignments and projects have required breaking down large problems into more manageable steps. I’ve always tried to ensure that my solutions are robust and scalable, so that I’m learning to develop not just for today, but for tomorrow.</p>

<p>I’ve had to collaborate with my peers through regular discussions, and I’ve always approached my assignments by asking myself, “Who am I designing for? Who are my stakeholders?” This mindset has helped me focus on user needs and allowed me to communicate technical decisions clearly and effectively. Whether I’m documenting system design, creating diagrams, or preparing project summaries, I’ve worked to ensure my communication is concise, professional, and tailored to my intended audience.</p>

<p>I’ve gained proficiency in key areas such as algorithms and data structures, databases, software design and engineering, and security. Outside of the artifacts contained in this course, I’ve worked with vectors and arrays, linked lists, and hashmaps, as well as secure CRUD operations with MongoDB and SQL. I have also worked with SQLite for a project that I needed to develop an android application for. These experiences, paired with other assignments that have emphasized secure coding practices, have helped solidify my ability to write clean, efficient, and secure code.</p>

<h2 id="portfolio-summary">Portfolio Summary</h2>
<p>The artifacts and enhancements exhibited in this course were selected to demonstrate a range of technical and professional skills that align with the five course outcomes across three specific categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Software Design &amp; Engineering</li>
  <li>Algorithms &amp; Data Structures</li>
  <li>Databases</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>first enhancement</strong>, a smart thermostat and remote-control software, showcases my abilities in software design and engineering. This artifact demonstrates my capacity to design modular systems for embedded environments, implement real-time communication protocols, and create user-friendly interfaces. It aligns with my course outcomes by allowing for collaboration through structured documentation, professional communication through documentation and the project narrative, and algorithmic problem-solving adapted to embedded system constraints. In it I also implemented, well-founded techniques such as real-time scheduling with TI-RTOS and TCP socket communication for practical functionality.</p>

<p>The <strong>second enhancement</strong>, a course planning tool that was originally built with binary search tree (BST). It was chosen to showcase my understanding of algorithms and data structures by redesigning it to use an AVL tree for improved scalability and efficiency. This enhancement demonstrates how I have applied algorithmic principles and modern C++ practices like smart pointers and modular design, improved the project documentation and comments, and showcased a security mindset by preventing memory-related vulnerabilities using smart pointers and exception handling.\</p>

<p>The <strong>third enhancement</strong>, an investment management application, demonstrates my understanding databases and security principles. I replaced hardcoded credentials and plaintext storage with a secure, authenticated system using MongoDB, bcrypt hashing, and role-based access controls (RBAC). The improvements to this artifact demonstrate awareness of security concerns and scalable system design. It also showcases the use of industry-standard tools and technologies. I also improved the code’s clarity and maintainability with consistent in-line documentation and error handling routines.</p>

<h3 id="artifact-1-smart-thermostat"><a href="https://github.com/calebmirwin/CS499/tree/main/Artifact%201" class="btn">Artifact 1: Smart Thermostat</a></h3>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> The original artifact is a smart thermostat program developed in December 2024 for CS-350: <em>Emerging Systems Architectures and Technologies</em>. It was built using the CC3220S LaunchPad. The original program simulated smart thermostat functionality by using UART for server communication, I2C to read temperature data, onboard buttons to adjust the setpoint, and an LED to indicate heat activation.</p>

<p><strong>Enhancement:</strong> This enhancement expanded the functionality of the original artifact by converting from NORTOS to TI-RTOS in order to support real-time scheduling and by replacing the UART interface with Wi-Fi-based two-way TCP socket communication, though UART was retained for debugging. The internet connectivity allowed for time synchronization with NTP servers to allow for implementation of daily setpoint scheduling. I also created a Python remote control application with a graphical user interface (GUI) to control the smart thermostat remotely.</p>

<h3 id="artifact-2-abcu-advising-program"><a href="https://github.com/calebmirwin/CS499/tree/main/Artifact%202" class="btn">Artifact 2: ABCU Advising Program</a></h3>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> The original artifact is an advising program from CS300: <em>Data Structures and Algorithms: Analysis and Design</em>, developed in February 2024. The program required that it import a list of courses from a CSV file, and have the functionality to display all courses in order or search for a specific course. I was required to construct the program using an array, hash table, or BST. Due to the need to frequently search and display courses in alphabetical order, I chose to implement a BST. The dataset provided for this project resulted in a balanced tree.</p>

<p><strong>Enhancement:</strong> Although the original dataset resulted in a balanced tree, this is unlikely in a real-world scenario and any insertions or deletions could quickly result in an unbalanced tree. This enhancement improved the performance and reliability of the original advising program by refactoring its underlying data structure from a standard BST to an AVL tree, a self-balancing variant that ensures efficient operations even in worst-case scenarios. To implement this, I developed a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rebalance()</code> method and supporting helper methods such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">leftRotate()</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rightRotate()</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">height()</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">updateHeight()</code> to maintain tree balance dynamically after insertions and deletions. A flowchart outlining the logic of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rebalance()</code> method is depicted below. I also transitioned the program to use smart pointers to improve memory safety and reduce the risk of leaks or dangling references, as well as incorporated structured exception handling to replace basic output error messages with more robust error management.</p>

<h3 id="artifact-3-investment-app"><a href="https://github.com/calebmirwin/CS499/tree/main/Artifact%203" class="btn">Artifact 3: Investment App</a></h3>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> The original artifact is an investment application from CS410: <em>Software Reverse Engineering</em>, developed in February 2025. The program required that I reverse-engineer a compiled binary back into C++ source code and then identify and address its security vulnerabilities. One of the biggest issues with the original program was its heavy use of hardcoded data. This is not only a security concern, but also limits the programs maintainability and scalability. The program lacked any form of persistent storage or user authentication, and it stored plaintext client information and passwords directly in the source code.</p>

<p><strong>Enhancement:</strong> This enhancement improved the original application by replacing hardcoded data with a secure and scalable database. The program was refactored from C++ to Python in order to simplify integration with MongoDB and bcrypt. The updated design implements hashed and salted passwords and RBAC to ensure that only authorized users can access or modify sensitive information. A dynamic menu system was used to adjust the menu options based on the logged in user’s roles.</p>
